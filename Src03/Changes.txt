List of Changes
====================
Date:09/07/2015
----------------
CFML_ILL_Instrm_Data: Deleted "save" argument in CURRENT_ORIENT variable (Why use save in a general variable name?)
CFML_ILL_Instrm_Data: Initializing as blank line in the definition for ILL_Data_Directory
CFML_ILL_Instrm_Data: Initializing as blank line in the definition for ILL_Temp_directory
CFML_Crystal_Metrics: Changes in Read_Bin_Crystal_Cell and Write_Bin_Crystal_Cell


Date:08/07/2015
----------------
CFML_Crystal_Metrics: Reorder in the CRYSTAL_CELL_TYPE definition
CFML_Crystal_Metrics: OK argument has been eliminated in Get_Basis_From_UVW. Now any problem is reported using Err_Crys variable.
CFML_Crystal_Metrics: OK argument has been eliminated in Get_Conventional_Cell. Now any problem is reported using Err_Crys variable.
CFML_Crystal_Metrics: OK argument has been eliminated in Get_Transfm_Matrix. Now any problem is reported using Err_Crys variable.

Date:07/07/2015
----------------
CFML_Diffraction_Patterns: Changes in the name of variables of the type Diffraction_Pattern_Type
CFML_BVS_Table: Rename references variable for BVS_Ref

Date:03/07/2015
----------------
CFML_BVS_Table: Rename the module from CFML_BVSpar to CFML_BVS_Table
CFML_Optimization_LSQ: Enorm (euclidean_normalization) was replaced by intrinsic function NORM2

Date:02/07/2015
----------------
CFML_String_Util: Get_Mat_symb routine is called now Get_Mat_From_String. Also the order of arguments were changed.
CFML_String_Util: Get_Num_String routine is called now Get_Num_From_String. Also the order of arguments were changed.
CFML_String_Util: Get_Substring_Positions is called now Get_Substring_Pos. Also the order of arguments were changed.
CFML_String_Util: Get_Transf is called now Get_MatVec_From_String.
CFML_String_Util: Read_Fract is called now Read_Fract_String.

Date:01/07/2015
----------------
CFML_Math_Gen: BESSJ0,BESSJ1,BESSJ deleted. Now they are internal procedures in the Fortran compilers 2008 (BESSEL_J0, BESSEL_J1, BESSEL_JN)
CFML_Math_Gen: PYTHAG deleted. Now is internal procedure in Fortran compiler 2008 (HYPOT)
CFML_Math_Gen: Eucliden_Norm deleted. Now is internal procedure in Fortran compiler 2008 (NORM2)
