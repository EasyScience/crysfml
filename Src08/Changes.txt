Changes:
1.- Global Error Flags
     A type variable called err_CFML whose components are:
     Err_CFML%state        Logical
     Err_CFML%Flag         Integer
     Err_CFML%Msg          Character
     
2.- Define a procedure to clear error variables called CLEAR_ERROR     
    
Changes on CFML_Math_General Procedures
=======================================     
1.- Trigonometric functions in degrees (CosD, SinD,...) are now supported by intrinsic procedures 
2.- Using intrinsic Bessel functions (BESSEL_J0, BESSEL_J1, BESSEL_JN, BESSEL_Y0, BESSEL_Y1, BESSEL_YN) 
3.- Using an intrinsic ERF function 
4.- Euclidean_Norm with sorted arguments as Vector, dimension
5.- IMINLOC, IMAXLOC are deleted. Use now the intrinsic function MINLOC, MAXLOC
6.- Define as optional the dimension of the array for Equal_matrix and Equal Vector
7.- Change the order of the arguments in IN_LIMITS
8.- Set_EPGSS without arguments set to default value
9.- Eliminated RTAN

Changes on CFML_Math3D
=========================
1.- Deleted the Polyhedron_volume procedure
2.- Changed names of procedures
    Determ_A -> Determ_3x3

1.- Renamed Reference to REF_BVS

Changes on CFML_Crystal_Metric
================================
1.- Recip -> ReciprocalCell
2.- Now the routines using class type for different types
3.- Type: CrysCell_Type     Basic form and Ancient for the rest types by extension
          CrysCell_M_Type
          CrysCell_LS_Type
          CrysCell_MLS_Type
