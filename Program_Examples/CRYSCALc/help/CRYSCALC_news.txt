       some keywords shortcuts (max. = 10). The shortcut and its
       details (CRYSCALC keyword) has to be separated by "=" character.
       Example: RJC = READ_CIF job.cif
     # New parameters in [OPTIONS] section of the cryscalc.ini
       setting file. These parameters are used for simulation
       of powder diffraction file from command line and .CIF/.INS
       file (create_PAT_PRF=1)
        pdp_beam   = N    ! N for neutrons / X for X-rays
        pdp_wave   = 1.22 ! wavelength used for diffraction pattern

       refinement software and next ones to supplementary cif files
       to complete the archive.

     # FIND_HKL_list argument value can be negative and allows to search
       reflections with opposite rule than for positive value.
     # SIR_TO_INS command line argument has been replaced by SOLVE_TO_INS
       and allows now to create INS file for SHELXL from SHELXS ouput file

     # WRITE_HKL keyword has been replaced by FIND_HKL_LIST.
       The SUPPRESS/REMOVE argument for FIND_HKL_LIST keyword
       has been added, leading to the creation of a new file free of
       data obeying the current selection rule.

     # TWIN_PSEUDO_HEXA keyword
     # TWIN_HEXA keyword
     # Bugs in the routine to create the archive_cryscalc.cif file has
       been corrected, specially when the archive.cif file is created
       from the "create CIF / ACTA-C" procedure in WinGX, where the
       order of some CIF fields is changed.
     # CRYSCALC has been compiled with new version of CFML (4.00)

     # .RAW file can be given as argument in the command line
       i.e. d:\> CRYSCALC my_file.RAW
       CRYSCALC is then reading my_file.RAW and will create a
       my_file_RAW.HKL file in a SHELX format. This file also contains
       dir. cos. for further absorption correction.
       Same behavior can be optained by associating a selected RAW file to
       CRYSCALC program in the Windows file folder
   
   . Nov. 08:
     # GEN_HKL accepts now Q_min and Q_max arguments
     # SEARCH_HKL arguments can be h, k or l letters.

       Create job.ins file from :
         . output.RES file created by SIR programs
         . struct.cif file created by WinGX
       This job.ins can be directly used for structure refinement with
       SHELXL, and contains right cell parameters and esd's, Mo wavelength
       and useful instructions such as ACTA, BOND$H, CONF, TEMP ...

     # CIF file can be given as a second argument if "REPORT" or "REPORT_long"
       is given at first. A CIF_file_structural_report.HTML is then created
       ex: d:\cryscalc report_long my_CIF_file.CIF
     # P4P file can be given as argument in the command line to run CRYSCALC,
       i.e. CRYSCALC my_file.P4P.
       CRYSCALC is then reading my_file.P4P and my_file.HKL to create
       import.CIF file for WinGX
       Same behavior can be optained by associating a selected P4P file to
       CRYSCALC program in the Windows file folder
   
   . april 07:
     # MERGE keyword: merge equivalent reflections of the current HKL file

       CRYSCALC is looking in the current folder for the presence of a
       "archive.cif" file: "structural_report.html" file is then created
       and contains text about the crystallographic study. The browser
       defined in the "cryscalc.ini" file is then launch

     # \> cryscalc P4P:
        CRYSCALC is looking in the current folder, for a P4P file (created
        by SAINT) and a HKL file (created by SADABS). Import.cif file is then
        created and can be directly read by WinGX as a KappaCCD file
