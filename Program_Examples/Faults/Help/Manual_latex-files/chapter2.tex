\section{Stacking faults in LiNiO$_{2}$}

Lithium nickel oxide has been intensively studied as a positive electrode material in Li-ion batteries \cite{Whit2004}.
As other lithium transition metal oxides, it crystallizes in an O3-type layered structure consisting in three NiO$_{2}$ slabs per unit cell, with an ABCABC oxygen stacking sequence, and lithium ions located in the octahedral sites of the interlayer spaces (see figure \ref{estructura}). In order to explain the significant broadening of the (10\emph{l}) and (01\emph{l}) diffraction lines, DIFFaX simulations have been used for this material with the hypothesis of the existence of O1 stacking faults in the structure at low lithium concentrations (Li$_{\epsilon}$Ni$_{1.02}$O$_{2}$, $\epsilon\leq$ 0.3) \cite{Crog2000}. These stacking faults represent a break in the normal stacking sequence of the structure, with a local ABAB oxygen stacking sequence.

\label{estructura}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The ideal structure can be described with three layers, each one containing a NiO$_{2}$ slab and a lithium interslab. The three layers are structurally identical, but shifted with respect to each other, resulting in transition vectors $\vec{t}_{12}$=$\vec{t}_{23}$=$\vec{t}_{31}$=(2/3 1/3 1/3) and a stacking probability of 1 for each transition. O1 defects require the definition of a new type of layer, structurally different, since these defective layers do not contain any lithium (see figure \ref{esquemacapes}). Therefore, three more layers are defined in the faulted structure, structurally identical between each other but different from the previous ones, and new transitions are allowed  in order to describe the defects (see figure \ref{capes}).

\section{Analysis of simulated data}
\label{Analysis of simulated data}

By  means of the  stacking description described above, FAULTS has been used to simulate a diffraction pattern with the parameter's values described in table \ref{taulasim}.
The obtained simulated XRD pattern for Li$_{\epsilon}$Ni$_{1.02}$O$_{2}$ ($\epsilon\leq$ 0.3) has then been used to analyse and test out the program. This are also the example files (LiNiO2_simul.flts and LiNiO2_refine.flts) included with the program. The refinement has been done by means of the Levenberg Marquart minimization algorithm, restraining the program to a maximum of 2400 function evaluations and a criterion of convergence 0.1e-4. As an example of the refinement process, the initial values of the refined parameters, which have been chosen far enough from the correct ones not to bias the result,
and  the final refined values are also  shown in table \ref{taulasim}.
A visual comparison between the calculated and the simulated powder patterns and their difference is shown in figure \ref{sim}.
Starting Rp and Chi$^{2}$ values were 109.90 $\%$  and 365.23 respectively and reached a final value of 1.38$\%$ and 0.06 respectively.
The values of the refined parameters are very close to those used in the simulation and lead to a XRD pattern practically
identical to the one obtained with the values of these parameters used in the simulation (see figure \ref{sim}).
