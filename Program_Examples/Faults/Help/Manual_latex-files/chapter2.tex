A simulated XRD pattern for LiNiO$_{2}$ has been used to analyse and test out the program. 
The initial values of the refinement have been chosen far enough from the correct ones not to bias the result.
The refinement has  been carried out using the Levenberg-Marquardt fit. 


\section{Stacking faults in LiNiO$_{2}$}

Lithium nickel oxide has been intensively studied as a positive electrode material in Li-ion batteries \cite{Whit2004}. 
As other lithium transition metal oxides it presents an O3-type layered structure, consisting in three NiO$_{2}$ slabs per unit cell with an ABCABC oxygen stacking sequence and lithium ions located in the octahedral sites of the interlayer spaces (see figure \ref{estructura}). In order to explain the significant broadening of the (10l) and (01l) diffraction lines, DIFFaX simulations have been used for this material with the hypothesis of the existence of O1 stacking faults in the structure \cite{Crog2000}. These stacking faults represent a break in the normal stacking sequence of the structure, with a local ABAB oxygen stacking sequence.

The ideal structure can be described with three layers, each one containing a NiO$_{2}$ slab and a lithium sheet. The three layers are structurally identical, but shifted with respect to each other, resulting in transition vectors $\vec{t}$12=$\vec{t}$23=$\vec{t}$31=(2/3 1/3 1/3) and a stacking probability of 1 for each transition (figure \ref{esquemacapes}). In the faulted structure the transitions $\vec{t}$11, $\vec{t}$12 and $\vec{t}$33 are allowed (see figure \ref{capes}) and therefore the corresponding probabilities are no longer zero. In this case, the stacking vector is (0 0 1/3).   
 
 
\section{Analysis of simulated data}

By  means of the  stacking description described above, FAULTS has been used to simulate a diffraction pattern with the parameter's values described in table \ref{taulasim}.
All the refined parameters using the Levenberg Marquardt optimisation algorithm are also detailed in table \ref{taulasim}. The evolution of Chi$^{2}$, R$_{p}$ and the evolution of the cell parameter's throughout a run is shown in figure \ref{cycles}. Finally, a visual comparison between the calculated and the simulated powder patterns and their difference is shown in figure \ref{sim}.
Starting Rp and Chi$^{2}$ values were 76.38 $\%$  and 174.66 respectively and reached a final value of 0.96$\%$ and 0.06 respectively. 
All the refined parameters are very close to those used in the simulation except those involved in the IRF, but the obtained values of U, and X lead to a Caglioti curve practically 
identical to the one obtained with the values of these parameters used in the simulation.
