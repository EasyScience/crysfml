        1: Use the program Simbo to generate the imput file myFile.mcm for McMag
           Prepare a CFL file from a given crystal structure. This file can be prepared
           by importing a CIF file into the program BondStr of the FullProf Suite.
           The CFL files needed by Simbo should contain the magnetic moment and the
           charge. McMag cannot work directly with centred cells, so Simbo transform
           the centred cell to primitive, so that the indices of translations are always
           integer numbers. In some cases it is more convenient working with the content
           of the full conventional cell. In this case it is to the user to construct
           the conectivity of all the atoms in the unit cell.
           An example of file generated by Simbo is is given below:

 *****************************************************************

      MCMAG is a Fortran program to simulate magnetic models from
  postulated coupling constants. Ground state configurations are
  obtained by a simulated annealing algorithm [S. Kirkpatrick,
  C.D. Gellatt Jr. and M.P. Vecchi, Science, 220 (1983) 671] and
  the configuration space is explored with random walks by using
  Metropolis importance sampling [N. Metropolis, A.W. Rosenbluth,
  M.N. Rosenbluth, A.H. Teller and E. Teller, J. Chem. Phys. 21
  (1953) 1087]. Any kind of 1D, 2D or 3D periodic model, magnetic
  cluster as well as real magnetic structure can be simulated
  without limitation of interacting distance.

  Further details on the method used for this purpose are given
  in the paper :
  MCMAG: a computer program to simulate magnetic structures.
  P. Lacorre and J. Pannetier, J. Magn. Magn. Mat. 71 (1987) 63.

  Topological and magnetic parameters must be stored in a file
  MYFILE.mcm (where MYFILE is a filename given by user)
  This input file contains a list of the magnetic
  sites of the structure, together with a list of their neighbours
  and corresponding exchange integrals, as well as anisotropy
  coefficients and spin amplitudes (for a complete description see
  the manual MCMAG.MAN). No symmetry element is taken into account
  by the program: all spins are independent.
  The so-called basic unit cell (b.u.c.) which is described in
  the input file represents the smallest sample that can be used
  for a simulation. Larger size samples are built up from the
  stacking of such unit cells along the three crystallographic
  axes and defined by the number of cells along these axes (namely
  LU, LV and LW for axes U, V and W respectively). Three kinds of
  boundary conditions are allowed:
       - free edges
       - periodic boundary conditions
       - mixed conditions (<=> free edges along W and periodic
         boundary conditions along U and V)

  The upper limit in sample size is imposed by the array dimension
  of the program. In order to allow an easy modification of these
  limits (which could be convenient for the study of specific cases)
  they are introduced as parameters in the module mcm_inc
  These upper limits are called :
       - NUMAX : maximal number of cells along the U axis
       - NVMAX : maximal number of cells along the V axis
       - NWMAX : maximal number of cells along the W axis
       - NAMAX : maximal number of sites per cell
       - NNMAX : maximal number of neighbours per site

  The initial configuration of spins is either randomly generated
  by the program or can be imposed (file MYFILE.ini).
  During the simulation, new orientations of spins are drawn at
  random and adopted or rejected (according to Boltzmann statistics)
  in order to progressively minimize the energy of the system.
  The Hamiltonian used for the energy calculation includes three
  terms :
       - a general two-spin coupling term with facility for anisotropic
         asymmetric exchange. General tensor [Jij]
       - a single-ion anisotropy term    Di(ui.Si)^2 (ui is a unitary vector)
       - an applied magnetic field term  H
  The energy formula per site i may be expressed as follows:
  (with the convention that a vector V' represents the transposed
  form of a column vector V)

       Ei = - 0.5*Sum(j){Si'[Jij]Sj} + D(ui'Si)**2 - H'Si

       where :
          Si,Sj  are vectors representing two interacting spins
          [Jij]  is the coupling tensor:
                                                         Jxx Jxy Jxz
                 for every <i,j> pair, [Jij] represents  Jyx Jyy Jyz
                                                         Jzx Jzy Jzz
          Di     is the strength of the single-ion anisotropy for site i
          ui     is a unitary vector indicating the direction of the anisotropy
          H      is the vector of applied magnetic field
          Sum(j) is the sum over all neighbours (j) of site i

  The reference used for spins is totally independent of the crys-
  tallographic one: spins are always generated and expressed in an
  orthonormal coordinate system during the simulation process. The
  same orthonormal coordinate system is used for the anisotropy
  coefficients and for the applied magnetic field ifany. For sake
  of convenience, a possibility is offered at the end of the
  simulation, to project the magnetic moments on the real crystal
  axes and to rotate the whole system to align one moment along a
  desired direction of the crystal frame of reference. This option
  facilitates the comparison between the result of simulation and
  real or theoretical arrangements of magnetic moments.

  The external conditions of the simulation (cooling rate, varying
  field ...) are introduced in an interactive way, as sequences of
  iteration on temperature at H=cst or on magnetic field at T=cst.
  The arrangements of magnetic moments and last spin configuration
  are stored during the process and at the end of simulation, respec-
  tively. Averaged characteristics such as magnetic susceptibility
  or specific heat and also energy and magnetization are collected
  at every step of the iterations.

  The following files are generated during or at the end of the
  simulation :

  - MYFILE.red : contains the sequence of instructions given by
                 user during the run of MCMAG (can be used as ins-
                 truction file for further batch runs)

  - MYFILE.lis : contains all informations about the arrangement of
                 magnetic moments and the averaged characteristics
                 collected at every step of the simulation process

  - MYFILE.res : created at user's request, this file stores averaged
                 characteristics collected at every temperature or
                 field step, for further analysis or plotting

  - MYFILE.spi : created at the end of simulation, it contains the
                 last generated spin configuration of the simulation.
                 The file format is the same as that of file MYFILE.INI,
                 which allows to split up a simulation in several runs

  - MYFILE.fst : created at the end of simulation for visualizing the
                 last generated spin configuration of the simulation.

  - MYFILE.cfl : created at the end of simulation for visualizing the
                 last average spin configuration of the simulation, or
                 for calculating the magnetic diffraction pattern.

       The main program calls the following Subroutines :

  read_FILE   : read input data and simulation parameters
  COMP_TEST   : check internal consistency of data
  MOD_INT     : ifactivated, modify some selected isotropic coupling
  GEN_SPI     : generate or read initial spin configuration
  MC_CYCLE    : execute the Monte Carlo loops
  EN_TOT      : compute the total energy of the system
  CONST_FUNCT : compute the constraint function (isotropic coupling)
  OUT_RES     : output averaged characteristics
  OUT_CONF    : output the configuration of magnetic moments
  PRO_ROTA    : ifselected, project moments on crystal cell (rotate)

  These Subroutines call other Subroutines or function :

  BOUND_COND : compute the selected boundary conditions
  ENn_CALC   : compute energy difference between new and old spin conf.
  RANnD      : generate a pseudo-random vector
  RANF       : generate a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1

  Four Subroutines ENn_CALC and four Subroutines RANnD are included in
  the program (n = 1, 2, 3 or q). Only one among the four is activated
  during a simulation, depending on the selected spin model, namely :
  - Ising spin model           (n = 1)
  - XY spin model              (n = 2)
  - Heisenberg spin model      (n = 3)
  - q-states planar Potts model(n = q)
